This project leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance customer satisfaction and product quality by analyzing recorded customer review calls. 
Using automatic speech recognition (ASR), the project transcribes audio reviews into text, applies sentiment analysis to classify them as positive or negative, and employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify recurring product issues from the negative reviews. 
By automating this process, organizations gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and can proactively address common product problems, fostering improved customer relationships and driving product enhancements. 
The project streamlines decision-making, promotes a customer-centric approach, and empowers organizations to make data-driven improvements based on real customer feedback.
